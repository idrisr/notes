# WAF

first off, learning new build systems can be a real pain in the ass.

I'm learning `waf` because Essentia uses it, and I want to use Essentia. More over, I want to explore the Essentia source code in CLion, and CLion doesn't support `waf`. Clion supports `CMake`, and to do a minimal conversion from `waf` to `Cmake`, I need some idea about how `waf` works.
