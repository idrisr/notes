# Send Grid

## white label
Domain whitelabeling adds an SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record to your domain and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) entries, which effectively authorizes and authenticates SendGrid to send on behalf of your domain. This is the best way to get rid of the "sent on behalf of" or "via" message that some email providers display.

Whitelabeling adds a CNAME record for a subdomain that you choose, which masks click and open-tracking links to your domain, rather than a SendGrid domain. This increases deliverability, builds trust, and strengthens your brand in your emails.
